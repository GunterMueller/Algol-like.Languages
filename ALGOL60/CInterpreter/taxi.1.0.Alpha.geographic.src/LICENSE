LICENSE GUIDE
-------------

This software is free, and can be used and compiled freely on any
Operating System you're able to compile it with. The programs you
develop in Algol remain yours, but the source code of taxi, which
interprets and run these Algol programs, remains of mine.

The source code of taxi is subject to the GPL license version 3.

If you want to quote the author of this program in the code parts
or functions you need to copy in your own code, use the following:

  "this <part of> code comes from taxi, the Algol 60 interpreter,
  version <version>, dated <date>, 
  developed by Antonio Maschio, Montebelluna, Italy
  @ ing dot antonio dot maschio at gmail dot com"

Add, if necessary, why you copy the <part of> code and where you
put it. Then send me a mail to notify me. I'd be glad. No charge
for this, the code is GPL.
